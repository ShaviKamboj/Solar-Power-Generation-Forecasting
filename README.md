# Solar-Power-Generation-Forecasting
This project aims to develop a robust forecasting model capable of accurately predicting solar power generation for the future.
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust forecasting model capable of accurately predicting solar power generation for future time intervals. The model will utilize historical solar power generation and weather sensor data to make informed predictions, contributing to efficient grid management, promoting the integration of renewable energy, and fostering sustainable energy practices.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two CSV files:

Plant_1_Generation_Data.csv: Contains solar power generation data for Plant 1, including columns for DATE_TIME, DAILY_YIELD, TOTAL_YIELD, and SOURCE_KEY.

Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv: Contains weather sensor readings for Plant 1, including columns for DATE_TIME, AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE, MODULE_TEMPERATURE, and IRRADIATION.
